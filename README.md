This is the second generation of my WebUntis Apple Watch companion app. Currently it implements a Apple Watch App with multiple complications. It is also offline capable. 

### TestFlight

You can test the app until I release this on the App Store via [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/g6eNWUlW)

**Note:** I don't go to school anymore. I still try to maintain this app. But for me to be able to release this to the App Store, I need a test login. The test login is required if you want to submit anything to the app store. However, because I don't go to school anymore, I can't submit my personal login. If you want to donate your login, then I can submit the app to the app store. Until then the app is only available on TestFlight for 90 days. After the 90 days I need to release a new version on TestFlight, or it just expires.Â  

### Supported login methods

- User/Password
- Secret
- QR-Code

### Supported complications

- Modular: Small and Large
- Circular Small
- Graphic: Rectangular, Circular, Corner and Extra Large

### Feature request

You can send me a mail if you need a feature or find a bug. However, there is no guarantee that I have instantly time for it. If I don't response immediately, it is maybe a sign for no time at the moment.
